### Introduction

If you’re looking to be happier, healthier, and more productive in life, it’s likely that you’ve heard of the concept of positive thinking. A lot has been written about this topic over the last few years as people try to understand what it means to have a positive mindset. But what does it really mean?

## Positive mindset and mental health environment

The first step to creating a positive mental health environment is to maintain your own. This can be done by surrounding yourself with people who are positive, supportive and motivating. You should also consider what's going on in the world around you so that it doesn't affect your mind negatively. If possible, try not to watch news stations or social media sites unless they're funny or informative.

## Belief in Yourself

One of the most important things you can do to improve your mental health is to believe in yourself. If you don't believe that you have the power or ability to accomplish something, then it's not likely that you'll actually do it. Believe in your purpose and vision for life; believe that no matter what happens, there will be a way out of any situation; believe in your ability to succeed at whatever goal or dream may come up along the way; finally, believe in your ability to overcome challenges—and above all else: never stop believing!

If we look back on our lives and think about how far they've come since then (or even just five minutes ago), we'll find ourselves with more confidence than ever before! We have learned many lessons throughout our journey thus far... but one thing remains clear: nothing compares with having faith in yourself and what makes YOU special :)

## Facing challenges head-on

Facing challenges head-on is important for you to be able to grow and learn. However, avoiding challenges will not help in the long run as they will only make things worse. You need to be able to identify your problems and deal with them as best you can.

## Self-awareness

Self-awareness is about being able to identify your strengths and weaknesses. It's about knowing how you feel, what you want, and why you believe it's important for you to achieve your goals.

When we're self-aware, we can see our own thoughts and feelings objectively—and that’s where mental health comes in! This helps us understand ourselves better so that we can make better decisions based on sound reasoning. That’s why having good self-awareness is such an important part of being happy as well as healthy mentally because it allows us to make better choices when faced with situations where there are no clear answers (such as when someone asks “What do I do now?”).

## Mental resilience

Mental resilience is the ability to recover quickly from setbacks. It’s important because people who are mentally resilient are less likely to experience depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.

People with high levels of mental resilience can bounce back quickly after failure or disappointment without feeling depressed or anxious about it. These individuals may have had difficult childhoods where they were bullied, but they still managed to grow up into successful adults despite all that occurred in those early years.

## Mental Health Environment

It’s important to have a healthy environment in which you can thrive. You should be around people who are supportive and encouraging, as well as understanding and tolerant of your struggles. If you feel like the people around you aren't doing this for you, then it’s time to change them!

The ultimate key to maintaining a positive mindset is surrounding yourself with the right people who support you.

To create your support network, look for friends and family members who care about you and make it clear that they're available if you need someone to talk to or vent to. When they see that you're feeling down or stressed out, they should be there for you—not in an overbearing way (which can actually make things worse), but as an active listener who listens not just for what needs said but also how it was said. By providing this kind of support, friends can help keep negative feelings from taking over their loved ones' lives too often; if one person has enough mental health issues in their life already—and probably does—having other people around them who care about them will help keep those feelings under control during tough times.

## Conclusion

If you’re struggling with any of these issues, we highly recommend getting some professional help. You don’t have to go it alone. And remember that there are many resources out there that can help you build a better mental health environment for yourself.
